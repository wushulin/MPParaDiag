# MPParaDiag
This is the code repository for "Mixed precision iterative ParaDiag Algorithm"
The Matlab Codes are mainly used to test the convergence rate and limiting error for the iterative ParaDiag used in a uniform or mixed precision mode. For Parallel Codes please read the corresponding README file for understanding how to use.
